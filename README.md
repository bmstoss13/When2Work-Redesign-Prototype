# When2Work Redesign

## Description
The contents of this repository document the development of a proposed redesign for the When2Work application. This software is used primarily for companies to help create, regulate, and manage schedules for its employees. While this application handles its intended purpose, my team felt as though there were design and usability issues that hindered the overall user experience for employees, leading to this project.

## Documentation
- The file titled "When2Work Redesign Prototype Outline" offers an in-depth report of our findings, interpretations, and development.
- Below, I have provided two **Important Links** - one for the figma file of our Mockup Prototype, and one to the presentation mode of this same prototype.
