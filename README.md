# When2Work Redesign

## Description
The contents of this repository document the development of a proposed redesign for the When2Work application. This software is used primarily for companies to help create, regulate, and manage schedules for its employees. While this application handles its intended purpose, my team felt as though there were design and usability issues that hindered the overall user experience for employees, leading to this project.
